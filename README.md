Student Projects in Tamil Computing
===================================

This project is coordinated by [International Forum for Information Technology in Tamil (INFITT)](http://home.infitt.org).

Purpose of this repository is to collect and collate potential projects in Tamil Computing or Information Technology.  The projects may be related technical research areas like speech synthsis, or IT projects like localization and translations.  INFITT will coordinate to provide a suitable guide to each of the project team, and will help in providing necessary tools wherever possible.

Proposing new project ideas
---------------------------

All interested parties are welcome to submit project ideas to this project.  You may either submit these via pull request, or send via email to the project coordinator.

Projects ideas should have a title, detailed description of the idea, domain & technical knowledge required in the project team if applicable, and any available mentors.  It should also provide expected duration for developing the project, and its suitability based on student's educational level.


Starting a new project
----------------------

Interested students may choose from the list of available projects, or may propose a project of their choice.  In cases where the idea is proposed by the student, project ideas must be approved by INFITT coordinator of this project. If any INFITT volunteer is available to mentor on the subject, he/she will be assigned to the project team.

Students will not be allowed to choose the same topic from already completed projects, unless they can provide a compelling reason why a redevelopment is necessary.  Multiple student teams may, however, choose the same project title in the same academic year, and try competing development.  Number of simultaneous teams trying a specific project may be limited at the INFITT coordinator's discretion.

Teams developing the software will hold copyright of their developments themselves or assign copyright to INFITT at their discretion.  Assigning copyright to INFITT is recommended in large projects where multiple teams have to work on it over the years.


Project closure
---------------

All student projects will need to be closed properly as per specific guidelines provided by INFITT.  This will ensure the developed software and code is made reusable and provides basis for continued technological advancement.  INFITT plans to coordinate with universities in Tamilnadu to draw up guidelines for student projects completed under INFITT umbrella. 

All software development projects shall be released via an open source license approved by INFITT, and should be made available through github repository under INFITT.  Students must checkin the project closure document in prescribed template together with the code.
